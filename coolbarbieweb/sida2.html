  <main><h3>Kevin, byrja hér.</h3><p>I have an intense love for Kevin the minion from all despicable me films and the 'minions' film by universal studios. His long, yellow, beany body makes me so hard. From the first time I saw his smooth ass fuckin' body I've wanted to shove my (2.86in soft, 6.07in) cock into his smooth yellow cheeks.</p>
  <blockquote><center>Sæll Tóti :), ég sá að þú seenaðir mig um daginn þegar ég óskaði þér til hamingju með afmælið þann 2.október, ég mun auðvitað ekki taka þessu persónulega ha h ha það er allt í lagi
  </center></blockquote><p> I have 7 different Kevin plushies and even a body pillow, yellow-colored anal sized fleshlight, and even a bright yellow horse cock. My Despicable Me styled bed sheets require 10 - 20 washes a week from my gunky spunk alone. I would be Kevin's slut, his femboy wife, and his cum dump. I want his warm yellow cock inside me. If I'm not in my bed jacking off, I'm thinking about him pounding me at work. In fact, I've been fired *17* times this year from me accidentally thinking about him too hard (If you know what I mean ;) ). My last job i was fired from (a desk job), i was questioned after they did a check of my office for an "awful metallic/rotting smell." They ended up discovering my 23.6 GB folder of Kevin porno's / pictures I found/edited.</p><blockquote><center>(Að seena er þegar manneskja opnar skilaboð frá annari manneskju en svarar ekki skilaboðinu)</center></blockquote></main>
  <article><h3>FitnessGram.</h3><p>The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.</p>

  <aside><h3>Kevin, enda hér.</h3><p>And on top of that, a sock that I accidentally left lying stuck to the bottom of my desk. I was fired and fined for the "Biohazard clean-up." Which was fucking $2500 dollars and a load of bullshit. On the topic of money, I've been fined over $16,000 for crimes/cleanups over Kevin. And over $2K on toys, lube, socks, sheets, and best of all, *Kevin plushies.* I fucking lied about the '7' minion dolls, no, I have over 300 minion toys, all either drenched in cum, jars of cum, or recently bought. Kevin is ruining my life, but he's the only thing left I have to care for. Family members disown me, friends are gone, and I can no longer own any pets after I was raided by police for fucking my yellow spray-painted dog (neighbors called the police after hearing him cry out) My fucking life is in shambles, and I'm not even sure why I'm still alive, but I can't stop thinking about *MY* Kevin. *MY* Husband. *MY LIFE*. I love you, Kevin.</p>
