<p>"Barbie and the Diamond Castle inspired me to do buy a cottage core farm and 
     live out my cottage 
     core dreams, This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good.
      No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers 
      which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Gino Nichele 
      did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based
       on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum"</p>

      <P>o put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will 
        be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone,
         but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema."</P>

        feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations,
         such as people walking such long distences and doing stuff that should actually have consequences but it doesn´t in the movie. I hate it; I fucking hate Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia."</p>
